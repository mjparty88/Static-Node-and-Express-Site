# Static-Node-and-Express-Site
A site to display my portfolio so far

Dependencies include:
- Express (for middleware and routing)
- Pug (for templating


Style Changes from original project files:
- Imported font Nunum Gothic from Google Fonts, and made changes across a number of elements to this font.
- Main background color changed to #F4F5F6 with left pane to #313335 in .portfolio-me (small changes, but changes all the same)
- Created personal logo in Figma and added to the about page and to the layout. Color is #C46D5E for future reference
